# Split And Combine
Splits any file into parts and also combines them back.
This Tool helps you to split or combine any file. Splitting can be done by two methods.
1. via specifying size of each split file in bytes.
2. via specifying number of parts for splitting.
    by_parts must be set to "True" for this method.
    This will inreturn override any size specified by user.
